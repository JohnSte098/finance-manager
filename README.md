This Canvas describes the `app_description_page.dart` file.  This page allows users to input annual income and categorized expenditures (housing, food, transport, entertainment). It dynamically displays a pie chart of the expenditure breakdown using `fl_chart`, complete with animation. Data is saved and passed to the home page for state management.
